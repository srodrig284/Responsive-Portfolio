          I graduated from Pace University in 1983 with a Bachelor of Business Administration in Management
          Information Systems.  Back then it was very tough to get an entry level position in IT.
          So I pursued a career as a Realtor.  Real Estate sales was convenient and allowed me the
          opportunity to raise my daughters and have a flexbile schedule.
      </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Finally, in 1999 I got my first programming position with Worldspan.  Worldspan was a Global
          Distribution System for the Airlines.  After a few years, Worldspan was acquired by Travelport.
          In 2005, Travelport close the South Florida office and I was laid off.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Later that year, I was hired as a contractor by EDS as a programmer for their airline area.  I
          language called Prolog.  It's a very interesting and fun language, somewhat similar to C but
          with a twist.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          In 2007, Travelport hire me back as a contractor working remotely.  In 2014, Delta Airlines acquired
          the Deltamatic System from Travelport and took the employees and contractors.  In 2014, I was
           converted to a contractor for Delta Airlines.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          I've been working from home for 9 years now.  I love it!  My goal is to work as a freelance Web developer
           or get hired by a good company as an employee.  I am going to own this Web Developer Bootcamp!!!
